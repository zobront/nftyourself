# Swirl and Mint

A simple app built with NextJS to create new images and deploy them as NFTs to the blockchain.

1) Experiment with merging two images using Neural Style Transfer. This combines the content from one image and the style from another.

2) Once you find a photo you like, deploy it as a 1/1 NFT to the Ethereum Mainnet, Matic Mainnet, or Rinkeby Test Net with one click.
